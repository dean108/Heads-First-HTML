		<h1>Segway's USA</h1>
		<h3>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway</h3>
		<h2>August 20, 2005</h2>

			Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places
			on the way: Walla Walla, WA,, Magic City, ID, 
			Bountifyl, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ, and Truth or Consequences, NM.

			I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
		</p> 
		<blockquote>
			Passing cars,<br>
			When you can't see,<br>
			May get you,<br>
			A glimpse, of eternity.
			<p>
				another paragraph
			</p>
		</blockquote> 
		<p>
			I definitely won't be passing any cars.
		</p>
		
		<h2>June 2, 2005</h2>

			My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed 
			and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot
			with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and protein bar. Just the essentials.
			AS Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one 
			Segway.</q>
